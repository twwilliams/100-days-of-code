## Day 0: 06 February 2018

### Today's Progress

- Figured out how the rules of #100DaysOfCode work and got my cloned repo and
  the log set up.
- Enabled stricter Code Analysis rules and handled warnings.
- Switched from string to enum for number type parameter.

### Learning Activities

- Watched [Vaidehi Joshi](https://dev.to/vaidehijoshi)'s [video on Linked Lists](https://dev.to/vaidehijoshi/linked-lists--basecs-video-series--2le8)
  in the BaseCS Video Series.
    - It is indeed very basic but she also teaches the concepts clearly. I wish
      the video player on dev.to had a way to change the playback speed.

### Thoughts

- Still trying to work out my own style guide. After spending so much time with
  Python this summer and the strict line-length requirements of PEP8, it's
  strange to go back to C# and VS where such constraints were never enforced.
  It's clear that 80 characters is way too short. I tried 90 for a while but
  that feels constrained, too. At the same time, 120 feels like I would just be
  abusing the system, so I'm going to aim at 100 in my C# projects for a while
  and see how that works. Just glad I'm not working with a team as I reformat
  files around these experiments.
- I have always liked enums. I love the extra bit of checking that the editor
  and compiler can do when using enums instead of strings. It does mean changes
  are a bit harder.
- I hate that code analysis rules fight so hard against default parameters. I
  find them so much more intuitive and elegant than a bunch of method overloads.
